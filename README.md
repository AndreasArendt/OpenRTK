# OpenRTK Precise GNSS

## Description

This project focuses on implementing Precise Point Positioning (PPP), Single Point Positioning (SPP), and Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) algorithms for postprocessing GNSS data. The main goal of this project is having a collection of high precision GNSS algorithms that are documented and implemented sustainably. Also, the main implementation will be in C++ for best performance.

## Status

- Basic RINEX file reader in C++.
- Drafts of SPP and PPP alrogithms in MATLAB. These will be translated and merged into the C++ main project
